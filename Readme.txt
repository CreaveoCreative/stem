Hi,

Things you might want to take note of...
In this work,
> Bootstrap 4 and Material Design Layout
> Angular Js routing is what is used for navigating pages
> Different views are in the 'views' folder
> Script for routing is in the js/controller.js file
> index.html is what is holding the navigation and footer

Well done.
